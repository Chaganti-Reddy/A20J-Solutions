#+title: IQ Test

Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given n numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given n numbers finds one that is different in evenness.

*Input*

The first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — amount of numbers in the task. The second line contains n space-separated natural numbers, not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed, that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in evenness.

*Output*

Output index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.
